Keep It Off / PowerOff Now
--------------------------

An Android application which will turn off the device upon boot.

Useful for devices that have the power button that is easily pushed when in
pocket, such as HTC HD2.

This app requires root.

This project was created using Android Studio 1.0 beta, and is not yet
completed or polish, it just works on my device and I am happy with the result.

Support is appreciated :)
